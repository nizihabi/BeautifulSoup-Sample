当我们需要定义常量时，一个办法是用大写变量通过整数来定义，例如月份：JAN = 1
FEB = 2
MAR = 3
...
NOV = 11
DEC = 12
from enum import Enum

Month = Enum('Month', ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'))
for name, member in Month.__members__.items():
    print(name, '=>', member, ',', member.value)
from enum import Enum, unique

@unique
class Weekday(Enum):
    Sun = 0 # Sun的value被设定为0
    Mon = 1
    Tue = 2
    Wed = 3
    Thu = 4
    Fri = 5
    Sat = 6
访问这些枚举类型可以有若干种方法：>>> day1 = Weekday.Mon
>>> print(day1)
Weekday.Mon
>>> print(Weekday.Tue)
Weekday.Tue
>>> print(Weekday['Tue'])
Weekday.Tue
>>> print(Weekday.Tue.value)
2
>>> print(day1 == Weekday.Mon)
True
>>> print(day1 == Weekday.Tue)
False
>>> print(Weekday(1))
Weekday.Mon
>>> print(day1 == Weekday(1))
True
>>> Weekday(7)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: 7 is not a valid Weekday
>>> for name, member in Weekday.__members__.items():
...     print(name, '=>', member)
...
Sun => Weekday.Sun
Mon => Weekday.Mon
Tue => Weekday.Tue
Wed => Weekday.Wed
Thu => Weekday.Thu
Fri => Weekday.Fri
Sat => Weekday.Sat
可见，既可以用成员名称引用枚举常量，又可以直接根据value的值获得枚举常量。use_enum.pyuse_enum.pyhttps://github.com/michaelliao/learn-python3/blob/master/samples/oop_advance/use_enum.py
